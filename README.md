# Advent of code 2019

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2019][advent] puzzles, done in the [muon][]
programming language. This is a very new, incomplete and in-development programming 
language that I just started using for fun, so the solutions might be less elegant
than they could/should be!

To build, install muon and run:

```
# $MUON_LIB should point to the muon/lib directory from the muon repo
$ mu ${MUON_LIB}/*.mu --args main.args
```
